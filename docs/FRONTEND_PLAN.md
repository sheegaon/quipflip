# Frontend Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides high-level guidance for implementing a Quipflip frontend. The backend API is complete and documented in [API.md](API.md). This plan focuses on the minimum viable frontend and logical phasing.

**STATUS: Phase 1 MVP is COMPLETE** ✅

The frontend is fully functional with:
- JWT authentication (access + refresh tokens with HTTP-only cookies)
- All three round types (Prompt, Copy, Vote) with timers and feedback
- Results viewing and prize claiming
- Phraseset tracking dashboard
- Prompt feedback system (like/dislike)
- Responsive UI with custom branding
- Automatic token refresh and error handling

**Next Steps:** Phase 2 enhancements (Settings page, Transaction history, Enhanced statistics)

---

## Phase 1: MVP Frontend (Core Gameplay) ✅ COMPLETE

### Essential Screens

   - Register new player (POST /player) → receive access + refresh tokens (legacy API key included for fallback)
   - Login form for returning players (POST /auth/login)
   - Automatic refresh handling via `/auth/refresh` + HTTP-only cookie
   - Store short-lived access token client-side (localStorage) and rely on refresh token cookie
   - Automatic token refresh on 401 errors with retry logic

2. ✅ **Dashboard / Home**
   - Display current balance with coin emoji
   - Show daily bonus notification if available
   - Display active round status (if any)
   - Notification badges for pending results and unclaimed prizes
   - Round selection buttons (Prompt / Copy / Vote)
   - Button state based on availability (GET /rounds/available)
   - Phraseset tracking navigation
   - Custom branding with logo and themed colors

3. ✅ **Prompt Round**
   - Display prompt text with custom styling
   - Text input for phrase submission (1-5 words, 2-100 chars)
   - Countdown timer (3 minutes / 180 seconds) with color-coded warnings

   - Status badges with color coding
   - Click to view details
   - Count summaries for each category
   - Pagination support

### Core Components

✅ **Timer Component** (COMPLETE)
- Calculate remaining time from `expires_at` timestamp
- Update every second
- Visual states: normal (blue) → warning (yellow, <30s) → urgent (red/pulsing, <10s) → expired
- Don't show grace period to users
- Custom hook `useTimer` for reusable logic

✅ **Balance Display** (COMPLETE)
- Show current balance prominently with coin emoji
- Update after each action
- Integrated into Header component
- Real-time updates via GameContext

✅ **Round State Manager** (COMPLETE)
- Poll GET /player/current-round on app load
- Resume active round if exists via GameContext
- Handle reconnection gracefully with AbortController
- Automatic cleanup on unmount

✅ **Error Handler** (COMPLETE)
- Map API error codes to user-friendly messages via extractErrorMessage
- ErrorNotification component with auto-dismiss
- Handle insufficient balance → suggest daily bonus
- 401 errors trigger automatic token refresh

### State Management

✅ **Implemented Global State (via GameContext):**
- `isAuthenticated` (JWT token status)
- `username` (stored in localStorage)
- `player` / `balance` (from GET /player/balance)
- `activeRound` (from GET /player/current-round)
- `pendingResults` (from GET /player/pending-results)
- `phrasesetSummary` (from GET /player/phrasesets/summary)
- `unclaimedResults` (from GET /player/unclaimed-results)
- `roundAvailability` (from GET /rounds/available)
- `loading` / `error` states

✅ **Polling Strategy (Implemented):**
- Balance & round availability: Every 60s
- Pending results, phraseset summary, unclaimed results: Every 90s
- All data fetched immediately on authentication
- Automatic cleanup with AbortController

### User Flow

✅ **Implemented Flow:**
```
1. First visit → Register (username/email/password) → Store tokens → Dashboard
2. Return visit → Auto-refresh access token → GET /player/balance → Dashboard
3. Dashboard → Check daily bonus → Claim if available (separate button)
4. Dashboard → Check active round → Resume if exists (automatic)
5. Dashboard → Select round type → Start round (disabled if unavailable)
6. In round → Submit phrase → Provide feedback (prompt only) → Return to dashboard
7. Dashboard → Notification badge → View unclaimed results → Claim prizes
8. Dashboard → Phraseset tracking → View all phrasesets by role/status
```

## Technical Considerations

### Framework Recommendations

**Web:**
- React / Next.js (most popular, good ecosystem)
- Vue / Nuxt (simpler learning curve)
- Svelte / SvelteKit (performance-focused)

**Mobile:**
- React Native (cross-platform, shares code with web)
- Flutter (high performance, native feel)
- Native iOS/Android (best UX, more effort)

### State Management Options

**Simple (MVP):**
- React Context API
- Vue Composition API
- Svelte stores

**Advanced (Phase 2+):**
- Redux Toolkit (React)
- Pinia (Vue)
- Zustand (lightweight, React)

### API Client

Create a typed API client using the TypeScript definitions in [API.md](API.md#frontend-integration). Consider:
- Axios or Fetch API wrapper
- Automatic retry logic
- Request/response interceptors for Authorization header injection
- Error transformation to user-friendly messages

### Offline Strategy

**Phase 1:**
- Show error message when offline
- Preserve access token metadata (with refresh fallback)

**Phase 2+:**
- Queue actions for later submission
- Cache recent results
- Service worker for PWA

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1 Testing

**Manual Testing:**
- Complete game flow (prompt → copy → vote → results)
- Timer expiration handling
- Error scenarios (insufficient balance, invalid words)
- Reconnection after disconnect

**Automated Testing:**
- API client unit tests
- Component tests for timer logic
- Integration tests for critical flows
- E2E tests for happy path

### Phase 2+ Testing

- Visual regression testing
- Performance testing (bundle size, load time)
- Accessibility audits
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing

---

## Deployment

### Phase 1 MVP
- Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- Environment variables for API URL
- CORS configuration with backend
- HTTPS required for secure token transport

### Phase 2+
- CDN for assets
- Analytics integration
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring

---

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
- Balance and timer should be most prominent
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Consistent color coding (green=success, red=error, blue=info)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Readable font sizes (minimum 16px)
- Landscape and portrait support

### Performance
- Minimize bundle size
- Lazy load routes
- Optimize images
- Debounce API calls

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Timer Sync Issues**
   - Always calculate from server `expires_at`, not client-side countdown
   - Account for network latency
   - Don't trust client time

2. **Race Conditions**
   - Handle rapid button clicks (disable while processing)
   - Optimistic updates with rollback on error
   - Check current round state before starting new round

3. **State Staleness**
   - Refresh balance after every transaction
   - Poll for round availability changes
   - Handle concurrent session detection (if needed)

4. **API Key Security**
   - Never log access or refresh tokens
   - Clear from memory on logout
   - Don't expose in URLs
   - Use HTTPS only

5. **Error Handling**
   - Always handle network errors gracefully
   - Provide actionable error messages
   - Allow retry for transient failures
   - Distinguish between client and server errors

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your framework** - React, Vue, or Svelte
2. **Set up project** - Use create-react-app, Vite, or Next.js
3. **Create API client** - TypeScript wrapper around fetch/axios
4. **Build authentication** - Landing page + token management
5. **Implement dashboard** - Balance display + round selection
6. **Add round screens** - Prompt → Copy → Vote
7. **Build results view** - Vote breakdown + payout display
8. **Test full flow** - End-to-end user journey
9. **Deploy** - Static hosting with environment config
10. **Iterate** - Gather feedback and improve
