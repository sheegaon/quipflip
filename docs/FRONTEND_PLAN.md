# Frontend Implementation Plan - Remaining Features

## Overview

The Quipflip frontend MVP is **COMPLETE** ‚úÖ. This document outlines remaining features and enhancements to implement beyond the core gameplay experience.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1 MVP**: All core gameplay, authentication, statistics, and tutorial system complete
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Quest system backend + frontend delivered (quests page, header badge, context)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Phase 3**: UI enhancements and advanced features planned

---

## Phase 2: Quest System UI (‚úÖ COMPLETE)

**Backend Status**: ‚úÖ Complete (database, API, service logic)
**Frontend Status**: ‚úÖ Complete (Quest context, components, navigation)

### 2.1: Quest Context & State Management
- `frontend/src/contexts/QuestContext.tsx` wraps the app with `QuestProvider`, exposing quests, active quests, claimable quests, and helper flags.
- Context automatically refreshes data on authentication changes and after reward claims, logging helpful diagnostics for QA.
- `claimQuest` revalidates state after API success and bubbles errors for inline handling.

### 2.2: Quest UI Components
- `frontend/src/components/QuestCard.tsx` renders quests with category-specific visuals, status badges, progress, and claim actions.
- `frontend/src/components/QuestProgressBar.tsx` provides themed gradients and progress labels that respect dark mode.
- `frontend/src/components/QuestSummaryCard.tsx` (inline within Quests page) highlights claimable, active, and total counts with celebratory styling.

### 2.3: Quests Page
- `frontend/src/pages/Quests.tsx` delivers the full experience: reward overview tiles, category filters, sections for claimable/active/claimed quests, and resilient loading/error states.
- Success banners and alert messaging confirm reward claims; retry controls surface when fetches fail.
- Layout adapts for mobile (stacked sections) and desktop (card grids with animation).

### 2.4: Quest Integration & Notifications
- App header treasure chest links to `/quests` and lights up when daily bonuses or quest rewards are available via `hasClaimableQuests`.
- Dashboard/Statistics surfaces include CTA buttons and summary data, all fed by the shared context.
- Claim flows trigger automatic refreshes so badge counts and balances update instantly.

## Phase 3: UI Polish & Enhancements (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### 3.1: Mobile Header Optimization
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**Delivered Enhancements:**
- `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx` reworked spacing (`px-1 py-0` mobile, expanded desktop padding) and responsive gaps.
- Back arrow, treasure chest, and balance display scale gracefully between mobile and desktop breakpoints.
- Interactive targets retain accessible hit areas while fitting within compact mobile header.

### 3.2: Currency Icon Replacement
**Status**: üöß Mostly Complete (Quest Cards Pending)

**Current State:**
- Header, balance displays, and daily bonus messaging use flipcoin iconography via `BalanceFlipper` and `CurrencyDisplay`.
- Some components (e.g., `QuestCard` reward label) still rely on hard-coded `$` prefixes.

**Next Steps:**
- Replace remaining `$` strings with `CurrencyDisplay` or equivalent helper for consistency.
- Audit results/prize breakdowns to ensure icons render with accessible text labels.

### 3.3: Navigation Improvements
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**Delivered Enhancements:**
1. **Back Arrow in Header**
   - Header shows contextual back navigation for Statistics, Tracking, Quests, Results, and Settings routes.
   - Replaces redundant "Back to Dashboard" buttons with consistent header affordance.

2. **Statistics Icon Next to Username**
   - Username button includes stats glyph (`/icon_stats.svg`) to signal clickability.

3. **Tracking Terminology Alignment**
   - UI labels now reference "Tracking" to match navigation and phraseset dashboard copy.

### 3.4: Balance Visual Enhancement
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started

**Goal**: Add subtle border around balance display

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Wrap balance in bordered container
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <img src="/flipcoin.png" />
  <div className="border-2 border-quip-turquoise rounded-tile px-3 py-1">
    <BalanceFlipper value={player.balance} />
  </div>
</div>
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Quest System Risks
- **Performance**: Large quest lists may impact load time
  - *Mitigation*: Pagination and lazy loading
- **User Confusion**: Complex quest mechanics
  - *Mitigation*: Clear progress indicators and help text

### UI Enhancement Risks  
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Header changes may break on edge devices
  - *Mitigation*: Extensive mobile testing
- **Breaking Changes**: Navigation updates may confuse existing users
  - *Mitigation*: Gradual rollout with user feedback

## Questions for Product Decision

1. **Quest Entry Points**: Do we need additional dashboard tiles/tooltips now that the Quests page is live?
2. **Mobile Header Iteration**: Are there further refinements desired (e.g., collapsible menus) beyond current spacing work?
3. **Currency Accessibility**: Should we add textual currency labels alongside flipcoin icons for accessibility?
4. **Real-time Features**: What's the priority for WebSocket integration vs other features?
5. **PWA Timeline**: When should offline support become a priority?
