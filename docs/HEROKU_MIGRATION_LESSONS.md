# Heroku Migration Lessons Learned

## Context
In October 2025 a Heroku deployment failed because the release phase could not
locate the Alembic revision identifier `guest_lockout_001`. Production
instances had been manually stamped with that identifier even though the
repository lacked a corresponding migration file. As a result, `alembic upgrade`
aborted during deploy.

## Lessons Learned
- **Track every historic revision identifier.** Even if a revision was created
  only in production, we must backfill a placeholder migration in version
  control so Alembic can resolve the revision graph.
- **Keep the migration chain linear.** Reconnecting the downstream guest vote
  lockout migration to point at the placeholder guarantees that upgrades follow
  a single, ordered path.
- **Test for gaps proactively.** The migration chain sanity test now accepts
  non-hex revision identifiers, so it will flag missing files like
  `guest_lockout_001` before they reach production.

## Practical Takeaways
- Add a no-op migration that mirrors any production-only revision identifier
  before deploying further schema changes.
- Re-run `pytest tests/test_migration_chain.py` after adjusting migrations to
  verify that the repository still forms a single head.
- Review historical deployment logs to uncover similar manually stamped
  revisions and backfill them before they block future releases.
