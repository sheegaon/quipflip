## AI Copy Service Implementation

### Overview
The AI copy service provides automated backup copy generation when human players are unavailable. The system supports multiple AI providers with automatic fallback and configurable behavior.

### Supported Providers
1. **OpenAI** (Default)
   - Model: GPT-5 Nano (configurable)
   - Fast, high-quality responses
   - Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **Gemini**
   - Model: gemini-2.5-flash-lite (configurable)
   - Cost-effective alternative
   - Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Architecture
```
ai_service.py          # Main orchestrator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openai_api.py          # OpenAI provider implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gemini_api.py          # Gemini provider implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompt_builder.py      # Shared prompt construction logic
```

### Configuration
Environment variables in `.env`:
```bash
AI_PROVIDER=openai           # "openai" or "gemini"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...            # OpenAI API key
GEMINI_API_KEY=...               # Gemini API key
AI_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-nano  # Model override (optional)
AI_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash-lite  # Model override (optional)
AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30       # API timeout
AI_BACKUP_DELAY_MINUTES=10       # Wait time before AI backup
```

### Key Features
- **Provider Selection**: Automatic based on config and available API keys
- **Fallback Logic**: Falls back to alternate provider if primary unavailable
- **Transaction Safety**: Proper transaction management in `run_backup_cycle()`
- **Validation**: All AI phrases validated same as human submissions

## Quest System Implementation

### Overview
The quest system provides 16 achievement types that automatically track player progress and award bonus coins. All quest tracking is fully automated through integration with existing game services.

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **Database Models** - Quest and QuestTemplate tables with migration
- ‚úÖ **Quest Service** - Complete implementation with all 16 quest types
- ‚úÖ **Quest Templates** - Pre-seeded in database with rewards and targets
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints** - 5 endpoints for viewing and claiming quests
- ‚úÖ **Service Integration** - Automatic tracking in vote, round, player, and feedback services
- ‚úÖ **Transaction Integration** - Quest rewards create proper transaction records
- ‚úÖ **Frontend API Types** - TypeScript types and API client methods
- üîÑ **Frontend UI** - Components and pages (IN PROGRESS)

### Quest Categories

**Streak Quests (3 quests)**:
- Hot Streak (5), Blazing Streak (10), Inferno Streak (20) - Consecutive correct votes

**Quality Quests (2 quests)**:
- Master Deceiver (75%+ copy votes), Clear Original (85%+ original votes)

**Activity Quests (4 quests)**:
- Quick/Active/Power Player (5/10/20 rounds in 24h), Balanced Player (varied round types)

**Engagement Quests (1 quest)**:
- Week Warrior (7 day login streak)

**Milestone Quests (6 quests)**:
- Feedback contributions, total votes/prompts/copies, popular phrasesets

### Automatic Integration Points
- **Vote Service** (`vote_service.py:283-294`, `vote_service.py:431-448`)
  - Updates hot streak after each vote
  - Checks milestone vote quests
  - Triggers quality quests on phraseset finalization

- **Round Service** (`round_service.py:186-194`, `round_service.py:424-432`)
  - Tracks round completion for activity quests
  - Increments prompt/copy milestone counters

- **Player Service** (`player_service.py:148-154`)
  - Updates login streak on daily bonus claims

- **Feedback Router** (`prompt_feedback.py:81-87`)
  - Increments feedback contribution quests

### Reward Economics
Total available quest rewards: **1,485f** across all 16 quests
- Encourages sustained engagement (login streaks, activity)
- Rewards skill (vote accuracy, quality performance)
- Provides long-term goals (milestones)

### Database Schema
```sql
quest_templates (
  template_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  description VARCHAR(500),
  reward_amount INTEGER,
  target_value INTEGER,
  category VARCHAR(20)
)

quests (
  quest_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  player_id UUID REFERENCES players,
  quest_type VARCHAR(50),
  status VARCHAR(20), -- active, completed, claimed
  progress JSON,      -- flexible tracking per quest type
  reward_amount INTEGER,
  created_at, completed_at, claimed_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /quests` - List all quests with counts (active, completed, claimed)
- `GET /quests/active` - Get active quests only
- `GET /quests/claimable` - Get completed but unclaimed quests
- `GET /quests/{quest_id}` - Get single quest details
- `POST /quests/{quest_id}/claim` - Claim quest reward

See [QUEST_SYSTEM_PLAN.md](QUEST_SYSTEM_PLAN.md) for complete implementation details.

## Testing Considerations

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Queue Imbalance**: Simulate 100 prompt players, 10 copy players
2. **Voting Rush**: 20 voters hitting same word set simultaneously
3. **Grace Period**: Submissions arriving 1-6 seconds after expiry
4. **Copy Discount**: Toggle when queue crosses 10 threshold

### Edge Cases to Test
1. Player disconnects mid-round, reconnects
2. Two copy players submit identical words (both should be rejected for duplicate)
3. Word set receives exactly 3 votes and sits for 10 minutes
4. Word set receives 5 votes immediately (should trigger 60s window)
5. 20 voters queue up simultaneously (should cap at 20)
6. Player balance exactly \$100 or \$1 (boundary conditions)
7. Daily bonus at midnight boundary
8. Clock skew between client and server

### Economic Testing
1. Monitor average earnings by role (prompt/copy/voter)
2. Track queue wait times
3. Measure copy discount activation frequency
4. Validate prize pool math (should always sum correctly)
5. Detect economic exploits or imbalances

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization (Phase 1)
- **API Key-based**: UUID v4 keys, unique per player, stored securely
- **HTTPS only**: Enforce in production (Heroku provides this)
- **Header-based**: `X-API-Key` header required for all authenticated endpoints
- **Validation**: Check Authorization header (or legacy key) on every request, return 401 if invalid/missing
- **Rate limiting (Planned)**: Prevent brute force on tokens/keys, limit requests per identifier
- **No password storage**: MVP has no passwords, just keys (simpler, mobile-friendly)
- **Future**: Phase 2+ adds JWT with refresh tokens for enhanced security

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- Server-side timer validation (grace period but not exploitable)
- Prevent self-voting (check contributor IDs)
- Prevent duplicate voting (one vote per word set per player)
- Word validation server-side only (don't trust client)
- Transaction validation (ensure balance sufficient before deducting)

### Data Integrity
- **Atomic transactions**: All balance updates use database transactions
- **Idempotent prize collection**: ResultView table tracks payout_claimed flag
- **Transaction ledger**: Every balance change creates Transaction record with balance_after
- **Optimistic locking**: Prevent race conditions on concurrent operations
- **Distributed locks**: Use Redis (or fallback) for critical sections (balance updates, queue operations)

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

**Economic Metrics:**
- Average payout by role (prompt/copy/voter)
- Win rate by role
- Player balance distribution
- Daily bonus claim rate
- Copy discount activation frequency
- Rake collected vs. prizes distributed

**Queue Health:**
- Prompts waiting for copies (alert if >20)
- Word sets waiting for votes (alert if >50)
- Average wait time: prompt ‚Üí first copy
- Average wait time: word set creation ‚Üí 3 votes
- Average wait time: 3 votes ‚Üí finalization

**Player Engagement:**
- Daily active users
- Average rounds per player per day
- Round type distribution (prompt/copy/vote %)
- Retention: D1, D7, D30
- Churn: players reaching \$0 balance

**Performance:**
- API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Failed submissions (by error type)
- Grace period usage frequency
- Timeout/abandonment rate by round type

**Game Balance:**
- Voter accuracy (% correct votes)
- Original vs. copy win rates
- Word similarity quality (measured by vote distribution)
- Most/least profitable prompts

### Alerts to Configure
1. Queue imbalance: >20 prompts waiting
2. Economic imbalance: any role avg payout <\$80 over 1000 rounds
3. Low voter participation: <3 votes per word set avg
4. High abandonment: >20% timeout rate
5. Server errors: >1% of requests failing
6. Balance depletion: >10% of active players under \$100
