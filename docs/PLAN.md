# Implementation Plan

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 - MVP (Core Gameplay)
1. Player accounts and authentication
2. Balance management and transactions
3. Core game loop (prompt, copy, vote)
4. Word validation (NASPA list)
5. Queue system (basic FIFO)
6. Scoring and payouts
7. One-round-at-a-time enforcement
8. Results viewing and prize collection
9. Essential API endpoints

### Phase 2 - Economic Balance
1. Daily login bonus
2. Copy discount when queue > 10
3. System contribution tracking
4. Queue depth visibility
5. Transaction history
6. Balance safeguards

### Phase 3 - Polish & UX
1. Improved error messages
2. Round history and statistics
3. Better queue management UI
4. Performance optimization
5. Mobile responsiveness

### Phase 4 - Engagement Features
1. Player statistics and win rates
2. Leaderboards
3. Achievement system
4. Social features (friends, challenges)
5. Premium prompts
6. Seasonal events

## Testing Considerations

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Queue Imbalance**: Simulate 100 prompt players, 10 copy players
2. **Voting Rush**: 20 voters hitting same word set simultaneously
3. **Grace Period**: Submissions arriving 1-6 seconds after expiry
4. **Copy Discount**: Toggle when queue crosses 10 threshold

### Edge Cases to Test
1. Player disconnects mid-round, reconnects
2. Two copy players submit identical words (both should be rejected for duplicate)
3. Word set receives exactly 3 votes and sits for 10 minutes
4. Word set receives 5 votes immediately (should trigger 60s window)
5. 20 voters queue up simultaneously (should cap at 20)
6. Player balance exactly $100 or $1 (boundary conditions)
7. Daily bonus at midnight boundary
8. Clock skew between client and server

### Economic Testing
1. Monitor average earnings by role (prompt/copy/voter)
2. Track queue wait times
3. Measure copy discount activation frequency
4. Validate prize pool math (should always sum correctly)
5. Detect economic exploits or imbalances

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens or session-based auth
- Validate player_id matches authenticated user on all endpoints
- Rate limiting on all endpoints (especially vote to prevent spam)

### Anti-Cheat Measures
- Server-side timer validation (grace period but not exploitable)
- Prevent self-voting (check contributor IDs)
- Prevent duplicate voting (one vote per word set per player)
- Word validation server-side only (don't trust client)
- Transaction validation (ensure balance sufficient before deducting)

### Data Integrity
- Atomic transactions for balance updates
- Idempotent prize
